4. Consistency: Data ready to use in toools BI.

Transformations applied:

- Temporal aggregation: Consolidates data by month.

- Report date: Uses the last day of each month (DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(MONTH, 1, ...)))

- Grouping dimensions: by account, month, currency and currency description.

- Totals: aggregates cost and position in each currency.

- Rounding: ensures consistent accuracy in 3 decimals.

- Accumulated totals: calculates sum by account and currency over the time.

- Window functions: Uses OVER(PARTITION BY... ORDER BY...) by acumulated calculates.

ðŸ‘‰ With this mart, business users and BI tools can efficiently explore trends, exposures, and performance across time and multiple currencies, with data already pre-aggregated for optimal performance.
