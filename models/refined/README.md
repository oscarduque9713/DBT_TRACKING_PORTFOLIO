ðŸ“Š Data model in layer Silver

The silver layer is the stage where data is transformed and cleaned.

Here, business rules are applied, formats are standarized and the data is prepared for analytics. 

This layer contains two views:

ðŸ”„ Execution strategy

Every model in this layer are implemented as materialized views in snowflake, this ensures:

Improved performance for frequently querys.

Automatic data maintenance.

Incremental updates where possible.

A balance between cost and performance.

The next step is the gold layer [Gold](../marts/README.md)
